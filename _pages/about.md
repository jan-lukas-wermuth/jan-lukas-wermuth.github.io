I am a third-year PhD student in statistics at the [Graduate School of Economics, Finance, and Management](https://www.gsefm.eu/about-us.html) in Frankfurt. Previously, I studied Economics and Business Administration as well as Mathematics at the [Goethe University Frankfurt](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/de?locale=de). 

My interests are econometrics and statistics, more precisely dependence measures and distribution regression.
